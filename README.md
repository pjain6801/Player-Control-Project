# Player-Control-Project
A Unity-based driving simulation / vehicle controller project.
This project is based on Unityâ€™s Unit 1 Driving Simulation tutorial, with additional enhancements: obstacle sound effects and particle effects upon collisions.

## Features 
- Responsive vehicle controls (steering, acceleration, braking)
- Physics-based interactions (collisions, friction, etc.)
- Obstacle objects that can interact with the vehicle
- Per-obstacle sound effects (each obstacle can have its own collision sound)
- Particle effects on collision (e.g. sparks, debris)

**Physics Interactions**
- Objects use Rigidbody and colliders for realistic physics behavior (falling, bouncing, rolling).

## Result
